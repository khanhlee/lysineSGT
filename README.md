# lysineSGT: Incorporating Convolutional Neural Networks and Sequence Graph Transform for Identifying Multilabel Protein Lysine PTM Sites

To run the web application :

### Step 1

git clone this repository to your local machine using the command below :

*git clone https://github.com/khanhlee/lysineSGT*

### Step 2

You need to have python 3 and tensorflow installed on your machine.
Install all the required python package dependencies using the command below :

*pip install -r requirements.txt*

### Step 3

Run the web server (the web server provided by Flask is not meant for production use) and Flask application using
the command below :

*python3 app.py runserver*

### Step 4

Open a web browser and enter the following url : localhost:5000

You should see the web server.
